# CFP Draft: Innovating in the Era of AI

**Target conference:** TBD (June 2026)
**Talk type:** TBD (session/workshop)

## Working Title

**Innovating in the Era of AI: Teaching LLMs New Tricks**

*(Alt: "When AI Favors the Incumbent: Strategies for Introducing New Patterns")*

---

## Abstract (Draft)

AI coding assistants are trained on the world's codebases—where dominant frameworks dominate. What happens when you're building something new? A library, a pattern, an approach that challenges the incumbent?

The AI drifts. It writes React when you want something else. It reaches for the patterns it knows, even when they don't apply.

This talk explores strategies for getting AI to adopt non-dominant approaches, drawn from real production work: rebuilding business systems at a real estate brokerage using libraries and patterns the AI wasn't trained on.

We'll cover:
- Why training data bias creates friction for innovation
- Documentation patterns that help AI adopt new approaches
- What worked, what didn't, and what we learned over 5 months of active development

## Speaker Context

CTO at a real estate brokerage building a tech-enabled vertical. Multiple active projects affected by this challenge:

1. **Reporting system** — Replacing Looker Studio with AI-generated HTML/CSS reports, using Azoth (a non-React JSX library)

2. **App rebuild** — Migrating from no-code/low-code platform to custom code, again using non-dominant tooling

Same challenge across both: getting AI assistance when the AI wants to write the dominant pattern.

**Meta-approach:** Developing these strategies *in collaboration with AI*—using AI to discover how to better work with AI. The insights emerge from the friction points in real pairing sessions.

## Timeline & Credibility

| When     | What                                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Jan 2026 | Begin reporting project, document AI drift patterns |
| Feb-Apr  | Build reports, iterate on documentation strategies  |
| Mar-May  | Begin app rebuild, apply learnings                  |
| June     | Present results at conference                       |

**Key point:** This isn't hypothetical. By talk time, 5 months of real work with real observations.

## Audience Takeaways

1. **Recognition** — "This is why my AI keeps doing that"
2. **Strategies** — Concrete documentation patterns that improve AI adoption
3. **Framework** — How to think about AI-era innovation and the incumbent advantage
4. **Encouragement** — New approaches are still possible; here's how

## Notes for CFP

- Practitioner perspective, not vendor/academic
- Live case study with real stakes
- Actionable strategies, not just observations
- Speaks to a tension many developers feel but haven't named
