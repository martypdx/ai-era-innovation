# 2-Minute CFP Video Outline

**Title:** **Innovating in the Era of AI: Teaching LLMs New Tricks**

---

## 1. Hook (~20s)
> "AI coding assistants have a bias problem—and it's not the one you're thinking of."

- AI bias toward dominant patterns
- Training data = market share
- New approaches fight uphill

## 2. Concrete Example (~20s)
- Azoth: JSX library, different mental model than React
- AI keeps writing React patterns
- Same syntax, wrong semantics

## 3. Why It Matters (~20s)
- Anyone introducing new tooling faces this
- AI amplifies incumbent advantage
- Innovation friction

## 4. What I'm Doing (~30s)
- Developing strategies through real production work
- Doing it *with* AI — meta: using AI to learn how to work with AI
- **Contrast docs** — "do this, not that" vs dominant pattern
- **Named patterns** — invocable, retrievable by AI
- **Philosophy docs** — the "why", not just syntax
- **Complete examples** — mental model, not just API reference
- **Counter-examples** — show what NOT to do
- **Type definitions** — guardrails that enforce correctness
- **Intentional naming** — diverge from incumbent terminology

## 5. Audience Takeaways (~20s)
- **Name the problem** — AI bias creates friction for innovation
- **Documentation strategies** — contrast docs, philosophy, examples
- **Naming for adoption** — diverge from incumbent terminology
- **Practical lessons** — what worked, what didn't, from real projects

## 6. Close (~20s)
- Practical strategies, not theory
- For anyone feeling AI friction with new approaches
- Results from 5 months of active work
