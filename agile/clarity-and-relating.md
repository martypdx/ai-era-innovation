## Draft Comment

Clear prompts do matter. But collaboration elevates clarity to relating.

Using the LLM to sharpen a question and analyzing what made it clearer is transactional. In collaboration, clarity emerges live. You don't compare before/after because you experience it together.

## Draft Repost Commentary

Samuel Woods makes a sharp point: clarity of thought and inquiry compounds. Practice tightening the gap between what you think and what you say. True.

And he's already doing something interesting — using the LLM to sharpen questions, analyzing what's good and what's missing.

That's still after the fact, though. Studying the transaction after it happens. Input, output, analyze, refine.

What if you didn't need the post-hoc analysis?

In real collaboration, clarity emerges *during* the conversation. You don't compare before/after because you experienced the clarification together. The understanding develops live, not through reflection on outputs.

Collaboration elevates clarity to relating. That's the foundation.

## Notes

- Tone: yes-and, amplify, invite deeper
- Acknowledges what Samuel's already doing (using LLM to sharpen, analyzing outputs)
- Reframes it: that's studying transactions, not yet full collaboration
- Opens the door: what if clarity emerged live?
- The co-written credit is the proof again
