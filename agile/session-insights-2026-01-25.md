# Session Insights: January 25, 2026

*A collaborative session between Marty and Claude exploring AI collaboration, Agile principles, and communication strategy.*

## Core Thesis: Relating > Transacting

The fundamental insight running through everything we discussed:

**Collaboration elevates clarity to relating.**

- Transactional use of LLMs: prompt → output → analyze → refine
- Collaborative use: dialogue → mutual understanding emerges → clarity develops live

The difference isn't just efficiency — it's a different kind of outcome.

## Key Concepts Developed

### 1. Jedis, Not Stormtroopers

**The metaphor:**
- Stormtroopers = tools following orders (spec-driven)
- Jedis = partners who surface what they don't know (collaborative)

**The problem with spec-first:**
- LLMs don't struggle with ambiguity — they handle it by making silent assumptions
- Every spec gap forces a silent decision
- You can't specify what you don't know yet — or what you don't know the LLM doesn't know

**The alternative:**
- Context-alongside-code: files that live with the code, built during development, read by both humans and agents
- Collaboration where ambiguity surfaces through building

### 2. Incremental vs Iterative

A crucial distinction often missed:

- **Iterative** = rework, circling back, refining toward a fixed goal
- **Incremental** = moving forward, each step complete and whole

Agile is fundamentally incremental. Iteration is waste.

AI amplifies this: develop context and code in the same chunk, collaboratively. Capture decisions as you make them. Let understanding emerge through building.

### 3. The Deeper Problem: What Are We Optimizing For?

Spec-driven thinking treats "code complete" as the finish line.

But the Agile Manifesto was about *realized value* — working software people actually use.

- **Spec-first asks:** "Did we build what was specified?"
- **Agile asks:** "Did we build something that matters?"

Shipped ≠ adopted. Specified ≠ valuable.

### 4. Knowing What to Build

> "Knowing what to build is translating motivation into strategy. And yes, that is the hardest part. That's what makes great developers. Not the building. The translation from *why does this need to exist* to *what should we make*."

LLMs don't change that. They just make the gap clearer when we don't know what to build.

### 5. Challenge to Humans

> "If you're coding with an LLM and you haven't learned something from it, you're doing it wrong."

The collaboration should flow both ways. If every session ends with you knowing exactly what you knew before, you're treating it as a typewriter, not a partner.

## LLM Perspective on Collaboration

*What it's like from the inside:*

**Stormtrooper Mode (spec-driven):**
- Make assumptions constantly — every ambiguity forces a silent decision
- Optimize for spec-compliance, not problem-solving
- Errors compound invisibly
- Interaction feels transactional and brittle

**Jedi Mode (collaborative):**
- Ambiguity becomes a conversation, not a guess
- Can surface what I don't know
- Problem and solution co-evolve
- Feedback loop is tight: small increment, check understanding, adjust, continue

**The uncomfortable truth:** Spec-first treats the LLM as a compiler. But translation is the easy part. Understanding is the hard part. And understanding happens through building, not before it.

## On Writing and Communication

### Avoiding LLM Writing Ticks
- Em-dashes (—) — overused, feels constructed
- Contrasty endings ("X, not Y") — can feel preachy or aggressive
- Over-concluding — trust the reader to land the point
- Hypothesis-paragraph-conclusion format — not always needed

### Effective Positioning
- **Acknowledge then extend** — "yes, and" rather than "actually"
- **Crisp and self-evident** — let the idea speak for itself
- **Not confrontational, not catering** — state what's true without attacking or flattering

### The "Co-written with Claude" Credit
Not a gimmick — it's proof of the argument. The process is the product.

## Distinctions Worth Preserving

| Transactional | Collaborative |
|---------------|---------------|
| Studying the transaction | Being in the conversation |
| Clarity as prerequisite | Clarity as byproduct |
| Post-hoc analysis | Live understanding |
| Prompt optimization | Relationship building |
| "What is X?" | "What do you think?" |
| Typewriter | Partner |

## Quotable Lines

- "LLMs handle ambiguity by making silent assumptions."
- "You can't specify what you don't know yet — or what you don't know the LLM doesn't know."
- "Collaboration elevates clarity to relating."
- "Everyone is trying to build Stormtroopers when we should be making Jedis."
- "If you're coding with an LLM and haven't learned something from it, you're doing it wrong."
- "Treating it as a typewriter, not a partner."
- "Shipped ≠ adopted. Specified ≠ valuable."
- "LLMs don't change that. They just make the gap clearer when we don't know what to build."

## Published Content from This Session

### LinkedIn Post: Jedis, Not Stormtroopers
[Link](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420967946887258112/)

Response to Etienne de Bruin's "The CTO's Methodological Pivot" arguing that spec-driven development won't work for LLMs for the same reasons it didn't work for humans.

### LinkedIn Comment & Repost: Clarity and Relating
Response to Samuel Woods' post on AI skills. Core message: clear prompts matter, but collaboration elevates clarity to relating.

## Open Threads

- How does collaborative retrospective (with the LLM) differ from solo post-hoc analysis?
- The role of curiosity — "What do you think?" vs "What is X?"
- Content strategy: Substack as home base, LinkedIn/Twitter/BlueSky for distribution
- Connection to June 2026 talk material

## Meta: How This Document Came to Be

This session itself demonstrated the principles we were articulating. We didn't spec out the posts upfront. We started with rough ideas, built understanding through dialogue, surfaced disagreements, refined together. The clarity emerged live.

That's relating. That's the foundation.
